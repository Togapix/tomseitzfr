            <h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
            <p>From 2 to 6 January, in my school, we did a seminar aimed at helping students find the exact job they want to do.</p>
            <p>During this week, we discovered several jobs in the field of IT of course.</p>
            <p>In the following sections I will present the activities we carried out throughout the seminar.</p>

              <p>Here are the notes I took during the presentations:</p>

            <h2>JOB RECAP:</h2>
            <p>The last activity of the week was to choose the job we liked the most and make a summary of it.</p>
            <p>To make this summary, we have made a table of the skills needed to do this job and a target that shows the skills associated with the job and how to obtain them.</p>
